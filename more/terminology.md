<h2 align=center>Hardware</h2>

<h3>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h3>
- The main processor that is responsible for most of the "work" and "thinking" for a computer.
<h3>RAM (Random-Access Memory)</h3>
- Short-term high-speed memory where the computer stores data it is currently using.
<h3>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</h3>
- A processor that can do lots of simple tasks quickly, such as rendering (processing the visuals, such as with a 3-Dimensional world) a game or running AI (but not as good as an [NPU]).
<h3>NPU (Neural Processing Unit)</h3>
- A processor very good at running AI. It's somewhat similar to a GPU but it was designed specifically for running neural networks (AI) so it is much more efficient than a GPU.
<h3>SoC (System-on-Chip)</h3>
- This is a computer chip that includes multiple processors that serve different functions such as the CPU, GPU, RAM, NPU, Power Delivery, I/O Controller (Connections such as USB and Ethernet), and more.
<h3>Thermal Pad</h3>
- This is a soft pad that conducts heat well and goes between a heat-generating component (such as a computer chip) and a heatsink (which is a large piece of metal).
