<h2 align=center>Other Camp Materials</h2>

- Your Own Computer
  - You will be accessing the web interface of the Orange Pi. A Terminal is also helpful for sending commands to the Orange Pi remotely (`ssh`).
  - Laptops are best, tablets (Android or iPadOS) can work but you had better bring a physical keyboard. Termius is a good remote terminal (so `ssh` app).
- Keyboard and Monitor
  - These are for installing the Operating System on the Orange Pi, after that you won't need them.
    - (You could hook up your computer to them, but that's irrelevant.)
- Installation Media - USB Flash Drive
  - Linux Distro Installer
-
