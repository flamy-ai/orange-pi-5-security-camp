<h1 align=center>Setting Up Your Orange Pi 5</h1>

<br>

<h2 align=center>Connect Ethernet Cables</h2>

1. Get out your PoE Network Switch
2. Attach the foam feet to the bottom of the switch
3. Take the power cord for the network switch and plug it into the power outlet and the switch.
4. Connect a long ethernet cable to port 4 of your network switch and our camp switch (this is how we connect the Orange Pi 5 to the internet).
5. Connect a short ethernet cable to port 1 of your network switch and the end of the PoE Splitter USB Type C with only one plug.

6. Connect another short ethernet cable to the end of the PoE Splitter USB Type C with 2 plugs.

7. Connect the DC barrel jack to USB C cable to the PoE Splitter USB Type C.

8. We purposefully left one end of the USB C cable and one end of the Ethernet cable from the PoE Splitter USB Type C unplugged.

<h2 align=center>Attaching the M.2 SSD</h2>

1. You will need your Orange Pi 5 and the M.2 SSD. You will also need the screwdriver the was in the box with the Orange Pi 5 case.
2. Find the tiny bag with a screw, plastic washer, and nut that came with the Orange Pi 5.

3. Insert the M.2 SSD into the M.2 slot on the bottom of the Orange Pi 5.

4. Place the washer on the hole in the motherboard below the M.2 SSD and place the screw through the fastener and hole, making sure it holds down the M.2 SSD.

5. Hold the screw in place and turn over the board. Find where the screw is poking through to the other side. Place the nut on the screw sticking through and tighten it clockwise (righty-tighty).

6. Now you can hold the nut with one hand and tighten the screw using the screwdriver from the Orange Pi 5 case.
